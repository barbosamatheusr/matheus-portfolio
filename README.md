# BJJ Analytics — Data Exploration of ADCC Matches

This project is a personal data analysis initiative focused on the **Abu Dhabi Combat Club (ADCC)**, the most prestigious submission grappling tournament in the world. Using Python and various data visualization libraries, I explored patterns in victories, submissions, and athlete performances to better understand the dynamics of high-level no-gi Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) competitions.



## Purpose

As a **BJJ practitioner since 2021** and a current **blue belt**, I’ve always been fascinated by the strategies and outcomes in competitive grappling. This project is the result of combining my passion for Jiu-Jitsu with my growing interest in **data analytics**. Through this analysis, I aim to:

- Understand common win types and submission trends
- Identify top-performing athletes in finals and superfights
- Explore patterns related to gender and weight divisions
- Improve my data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills



## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization


## Project Structure

- `ADCC_BJJ.ipynb` — the main notebook with all the analyses and charts
- Cleaned dataset loaded from a CSV file with match-level information
- Visualizations for win types, top submissions, stage breakdowns, and athlete performance



## Sample Insights

- Most common submission types across divisions
- Win type distribution (submission vs. points vs. decision)
- Top 10 male and female athletes in finals and superfights
- Year-by-year breakdown of athlete victories (M/F)



## Why This Project Matters

This project reflects my ability to **communicate insights clearly**, work with **real-world sports data**, and build visual stories using Python. It also highlights how I bring **domain expertise** into the data analysis process — in this case, from my own Jiu-Jitsu journey.
