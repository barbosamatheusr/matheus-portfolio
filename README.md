# Brazilian Higher Education Institutions — Data Exploration

This project is a personal data analysis initiative focused on the **Higher Education Institutions (IES)** in Brazil. Using Python and data visualization tools, I explored structural patterns in the organization, categorization, and regional distribution of IES registered by the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC).



## Purpose

As a researcher, and enthusiast of data-driven urban studies, I created this exploratory analysis to:

- Understand the distribution of active institutions across Brazilian states
- Analyze the proportion of public vs. private institutions
- Examine how different types of institutions (Confessional, Community-based, Philanthropic) are represented
- Practice data manipulation, visualization, and storytelling using Python



## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data wrangling and filtering
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualization



## Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available from the Brazilian Government's open data portal:

It contains institutional-level data, including fields like academic organization, category (public/private), institutional type, status (active/inactive), and state (UF).



## Project Structure
- — the main notebook with all the analyses and charts
- Cleaned and analyzed dataset based on active institutions only
- Separated visualizations for private vs. public institutions, and by state
- Category-type breakdown for Confessional, Community-based, and Philanthropic institutions



## Sample Insights

- Distribution of active IES across all Brazilian states
- Pie chart showing the proportion of private vs. public institutions
- State-level comparison of active public and private institutions
- Analysis of special categories of private institutions:
  - Confessional
  - Community-based
  - Philanthropic



## Why This Project Matters

This analysis demonstrates the ability to **derive insight from governmental data**, handle real-world messy datasets, and **communicate findings visually**. It also aligns with my broader interest in education infrastructure across Brazilian territories.
